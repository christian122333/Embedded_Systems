[Embedded Systems - Shape The World: Multi-Threaded Interfacing](https://www.edx.org/course/embedded-systems-shape-the-world-multi-threaded-interfacing)
# PART 1
+ Lab 2. Run existing project on LaunchPad with switch input and LED output

+ Lab 4. Debug a system with two inputs and two outputs

+ Lab 5. Write a C function and perform input/output

+ Lab 6. Write C software that inputs from a switch and toggles an LED output

+ Lab 7. Write C functions that inputs from a switch and outputs to two LEDs, which is a virtual pacemaker

+ Lab 8. Interface an external switch and LED and write input/output software

+ Lab 9. Write C functions using array data structures that collect/debug your system

+ Lab 10. Interface 3 switches and 6 LEDs and create a traffic light finite state machine
# PART 2
+ Lab 11. Write C functions that output decimal and fixed-point numbers to serial port

+ Lab 12. Design and test a guitar tuner, producing a 440 Hz tone

+ Lab 13. Design and test a digital piano, with 4 inputs, digital to analog conversion, and sound

+ Lab 14. Design and test a position measurement, with analog to digital conversion and calibrated output

+ Lab 15. Design and test a hand-held video game, which integrates all components from previous labs.

+ Lab 16. Connect a CC3100 booster pack to the LaunchPad and communicate with an access point. Lab 16 will first fetch weather from the internet, and then you will send data to the class server.
